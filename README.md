# About

This is an attempt to do the `Advent of Code 2023` - https://adventofcode.com/2023 in Haskell.

## Hints for myself

* Install a package (update and install, and stack for IDE support)
    ```
    cabal new-update
    cabal new-install --lib MissingH 
    stack install MissingH   
    ```
    Restart code afterwards for implicit ghc restart.
